            <h2>Metal Styles and Materials We Can Work With</h2>
            <p> Metal fences are predominantly made from wrought iron and aluminum, and each has its own set of benefits. Here’s a brief overview, although this page is by no means exhaustive.
 </p>

          <h3> Wrought Iron and Aluminum Fence Installation in Hilton Head </h3>
          <p>
      Wrought Iron provides strength, security, and classic beauty. It allows for intricate designs, scrollwork, or simple lines, and each fence is truly a unique piece of craftsmanship. However, it can be susceptible to rust, and we will speak with you about a proactive approach to maintenance, especially considering the coastal climate of Hilton Head.
      <p> Aluminum, on the other hand, offers a rust-resistant alternative with the added benefit of lower maintenance. It can mimic the look of wrought iron closely, and we can even install a classic picket fence, ornamental fence, privacy fence, or other modern option in aluminum. Aluminum even comes in wood-imitation styles. You’ll love the fact that aluminum can withstand the salty, humid air without corroding. </p>

              <h3>How Long Do Metal Fences Last?</h3>
          <p>
   Metal fences can last for decades with proper care. Wrought iron, if maintained correctly, can last more than a lifetime, and the fact that these fences are “legacy items” justifies the higher upfront cost. Regular inspection and immediate treatment of any signs of rust or damage are necessary to preserve its condition – this may involve sanding or using a rust-inhibiting primer on affected areas, followed by repainting.
         <p> Aluminum fences do not rust, and you will simply need to clean the fence from time to time with soap and water. Of course, if you notice that any fasteners or hardware are starting to come loose, let us know immediately.   </p>

                       <h3>Types of Finishes Available on Metal Fences in Hilton Head</h3>
          <p>
    Powder coatings are a popular finish for both wrought iron and aluminum fences. This dry powder, applied electrostatically and cured under heat, creates a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. It offers superior resistance to chipping, fading, and wearing, making it ideal for the coastal climate of Hilton Head. It comes in a wide range of colors, allowing you to choose interesting colors on your contemporary aluminum fence. Wrought iron, of course, is usually black.
          <p>Galvanization is another treatment, typically reserved for wrought iron, involving a protective layer of zinc to prevent rust. Galvanized fences offer an added layer of durability against the elements, though they may lack the color variety of powder-coated options.
          <p> E-coating, or electrocoating, is a process where paint is deposited onto the metal surface using an electrical current. We usually receive our fencing components already painted in this manner. This technique is often used in conjunction with powder coating for an even more durable protective layer.  </p>


               <h2>The Quoting and Installation Process For Your Metal Fence</h2>
          <p>
 First, we’ll chat with you about your needs, the materials you should consider, and ballpark pricing figures. After we have that out of the way, we can visit your property and see how much fencing we’ll need - we can also provide design suggestions. After you’ve approved your estimate, we will set up a time to start installing the fence. This usually only takes a few days, if that. We inspect for obstructions, dig post holes, secure the fence with cement, and set about connecting posts, rungs, and fasteners. We use high end corrosion-resistant hardware so that your fence will last for many years.

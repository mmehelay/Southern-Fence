            <h2>Does Wooden Fencing Work in Adams Run?</h2>
          <p>
            Wood fencing is a great choice despite the coastal South Carolina climate. With the area's humidity and salty air, wooden fences need a little extra attention to keep them looking sharp. Treating the wood properly is very important; pressure-treated wood stands up well to moisture, while cedar and redwood naturally resist rot and insects. Regular staining or painting helps create a barrier against the elements and keeps the wood’s natural beauty intact. Routine maintenance, like cleaning and resealing every few years, adds to a wooden fence’s durability, allowing it to weather the seasons while looking its best. We are happy to stay in touch and maintain your fence for you, if you choose to install a wooden fence.</p>

            <h2>Types of Wooden Fencing We Install in Adams Run</h2>
            <h3>White Picket Fences</h3>
              <p>
                Nothing says “classic” like a white picket fence. It adds charm to any property, creating a friendly and inviting look that fits right into Adams Run’s relaxed, small-town vibe. Our white picket fences are built from durable wood, painted to perfection, and ready to bring a warm welcome to your front yard. Picket fence styles include traditional flat-top, pointed, and dog-ear designs, each offering a distinct look. French Gothic and scalloped styles feature decorative tops, while arched and convex styles create a gentler look. Ask us for examples - we would be happy to share!
            </p>

            <h3> Privacy Fences</h3>
            <p> Let us give you a sense of peace and personal space. We offer a variety of heights and finishes to match your home’s exterior, and provide a seamless look that also functions as a quiet, private boundary. We also work within your neighborhood’s HOA restrictions, if need be, and we can show you a variety of privacy fence options to choose from.</p>

            <h3> Ranch and Split Rail Fences</h3>
            <p> Ranch and split rail fences are perfect for larger properties or homes that are suited to a natural aesthetic. Ranch-style fences use simple, horizontal rails, creating a classic look that defines boundaries without feeling closed in. Split rail fences, with their rough-hewn wood rails, add a rural touch. If you have animals on the property, we can also add a wire mesh that will keep livestock in, and predators out.</p>

            <h3> Metal Fence Installation in Hollywood, SC</h3>
            <p> If durability and elegance are what you’re after, our metal fences might be the perfect solution. Designed to withstand the elements, metal fences offer both beauty and strength. Southern Fence provides options in aluminum and wrought iron, two metals that are well-suited to Hollywood’s coastal weather while requiring minimal maintenance.</p>

            <h2>Metal and Vinyl Fencing</h2>

            <h3> Wrought Iron Fences</h3> 
            <p> Wrought iron fencing is incredibly strong and timeless. Whether you need fencing around a garden, a pool, or the entire property, you can’t beat the elegance of wrought iron. Our fences are treated to resist rust, so they are a smart choice for coastal areas. If you’re ready to turn heads and elevate your property value, ask us about a wrought iron fence. </p>

            <h3> Aluminum Fences</h3> 
            <p> Aluminum fencing is a great alternative for homeowners who want the look of wrought iron without the weight or cost. Aluminum fences often mimic the appearance of wrought iron while offering a high level of durability. This material resists corrosion and stands up well to humidity and salt in the air. You can even choose from a variety of colors and styles, letting you achieve the classic look of metal without the need for regular maintenance. </p>

        

            <h3> Chain Link Fences</h3> 
            <p> Chain link fencing offers practicality, security, and a low-profile look that works well for both residential and commercial properties. This fence type is budget-friendly, highly durable, and great for marking property lines, enclosing yards, or securing a garden area. Chain link fences are coated to resist rust and come in different colors, allowing them to blend with landscaping or stand out for added visibility. For those who want a bit more privacy, we can add slats in a range of colors to create a semi-private feel without losing the functional benefits.</p>

            <h3> Vinyl Fencing Installation</h3> 
            <p> Vinyl fencing combines the classic look of wood with the durability of synthetic materials to create a fence that’s both beautiful and resilient. Vinyl is impervious to rot and insects, making it a great option. Our vinyl fences come in a variety of styles, from privacy panels to picket designs, allowing you to customize the look without worrying about regular maintenance. Vinyl won’t chip, peel, or need repainting, making it a long-lasting, low-maintenance option for those who want a polished appearance with minimal upkeep.</p>

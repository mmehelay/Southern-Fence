            <h2>Installing Every Style of Wooden Fence in Okatie</h2>
            <p> Do you have a classic Georgian home that needs a white picket fence? Or do you live in a lodge-style house that would benefit from a split rail fence? Even if you need a ranch-style wooden fence to contain horses or other animals, we are happy to help. 
           <p> Beyond the regular fencing styles, we can help you personalize your property. We can add ornamental tops to the traditional picket fence, add wire mesh between the posts of your ranch fence to contain smaller animals (or keep them out!), and paint your fence eye-catching colors. Whether you want something highly traditional or contemporary, we are happy to work with you.
            <p> We also handle sealing, staining, and painting for all of our wooden fence installations in Okatie. Depending on the wood you use, you may want paint vs. stain, and we can talk through all of the pros and cons of different finishing options.  </p>
            
          


              <h2>We Help You Choose The Right Wood For South Carolina’s Climate</h2>
          <p>
   Homeowners in coastal South Carolina must prioritize woods that naturally resist rot, decay, and insect infestation, given the region's moisture levels, salty air and storms. It’s certainly investing in your fence up front rather than having to replace it every 5-10 years! Our wood fence experts at Southern Fence can chat with you about your options, pricing, and the availability of materials.
           <p> Cedar is always a good choice due to its inherent oils that repel insects and resist moisture, making it durable and requiring less maintenance over time. Cypress is another excellent high end option, as it contains cypretine, a natural preservative that protects against rot and insects, making it well-suited to the moist conditions of South Carolina’s lowcountry.
            <p> For those looking for a more budget-friendly option, pressure-treated pine is also a decent choice. Treated with chemicals to resist pests and moisture, it offers a compromise between durability and cost. We can also seal the wood to help it resist moisture further. 
                <p> Redwood is less common in our region due to its cost, but it offers superior resistance to decay and insects – it also looks beautiful and striking. </p>

            <h2>Let’s Improve Your Home Value With Beautiful Fencing</h2>
          <p>
            Every fence we build reflects the character of the property it protects. Our team also understands the challenges of the Lowcountry climate—humidity, salt air, and storms can take a toll on poorly constructed fences. We use durable materials and industry-leading techniques to keep your fence standing for many years to come.</p>
            <p> Whether you need a fence for a historic home, a modern farmhouse, or a waterfront property, Southern Fence has the expertise to make it happen. </p>
            <h2>Wood Fence Installation in Johns Island, SC</h2>
            <p> Despite our humid climate, a wooden fence might be the perfect fit for your property. They are timeless, and we can paint or stain the wood with almost any color. We will also make sure the wood is primed and treated in such a way that it will resist insects and rot. Give us a call and we’ll talk through wood types based on design and budget. </p>
            <h3>Privacy Fences</h3>
              <p>
                Let’s reduce noise and make your backyard more peaceful with a durable wooden privacy fence. We can use offset planks or simply flat panels, and we can also paint the privacy fence according to your taste. As always, we’ll adhere to local privacy fence zoning.
            </p>

            <h3> Picket Fences Never Go Out of Style</h3>
            <p> We can build a classic picket fence around gardens, pathways, front yards, and more, and you can choose from options like scalloped edges or Gothic-point pickets. We are more than happy to make suggestions and show you some pictures of our past work. </p>

            <h3> Split Rail and Ranch Fences</h3>
            <p> Do you have a larger property with a rustic feel? We can build a split rail or ranch fence with rough-hewn logs and beautiful color. We can also add wire mesh to keep livestock in the field, if need be. </p>

            <h2> Metal Fencing Installation in Johns Island, SC</h2>
            <h3> Aluminum and Wrought Iron Fences in Johns Island</h3>
            <p> Aluminum fences are lightweight, low-maintenance, and resistant to rust. It’s the perfect fit for a property in our humid climate, and they last for many years. We can also install an aluminum fence that mimics wrought iron, picket, or a number of other designs, and you have so many colors to choose from. </p>
            <p> Wrought iron fencing requires a bit more maintenance, but you can’t beat the elegance of an iron fence with ornate scrollwork and other metalworking. We’ll find the perfect style for your property and install the fence, and we can handle large enclosures or smaller garden fences. We can also add a gate to your wrought iron fence. </p>

            <h3>Chain Link Fencing</h3>
            <p> We install chain link fences almost every week, and practicality never goes out of style. We can even standard or black chain link fences, and we can also add privacy slats or gates with electronic operators – either single or double wide for vehicles and ATVs.  </p>

            <p> You won’t have to worry about moisture, rot, or pests with a vinyl fence, and you may only need to spray it off with a garden hose from time to time. Vinyl fences come in many configurations, styles, and colors, and it will last for a long time. </p>
           
            <p> If you have any questions about pricing, availability, or what kind of fence you should install, please get in touch. We’d be happy to speak with you and learn more about your fencing needs.</p>

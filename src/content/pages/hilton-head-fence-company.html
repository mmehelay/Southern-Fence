            <h2>Get Your Complimentary Fence Installation Quote</h2>
          <p>
         Hilton Head’s sandy soil, unique vegetation, and terrain create unique challenges for homeowners. We’ll walk through your property with you to discuss your unique needs and goals for the project, and we’ll have an itemized quote over for you to review in no time at all. Perhaps you’re trying to keep alligators out of your pool, keep your children in the yard, include a large gate for your golf cart, or even build a living fence – let us know, and we can speak with you about your options.
            </p>
       
        
            <h2>Trusted Hilton Head Fence Installation Contractors</h2>

              <h3>We Can Work Within Your HOA Rules</h3>
          <p>
        Authorities in Hilton Head go to great lengths to preserve the beautiful environment of the island. We understand that goal, and we can work with you to find the perfect solution within your HOA’s guidelines. Whether you can only install black aluminum, aren’t allowed to install regular chain link fences, or need to adhere to height and width restrictions, we can make it happen. We can also help you pull permits – fence permits are not common in South Carolina, but depending on the fence you need to install, we may need to get involved.
            </p>

              <h3>Replacing a Fence After Inclement Weather or Other Disasters</h3>
          <p>
       If you need our fence installation contractors  to be on-site for a meeting with the insurance adjuster, or if you need specific numbers that you can present to your insurance company after a severe storm, let us know. We would be happy to make the process as smooth as possible. Furthermore, we take the meteorological risk of Hilton Head into consideration when discussing fence options with you. You’ll want something that won’t rot when wet, won’t fade in the sun, and can withstand wind from time to time.
            </p>




               <h2>Attention To Detail At Each Step of The Fence Installation Process</h2>
            
            <p>Southern Fence has helped property owners in South Carolina’s low country with all manner of fences. We’ve installed countless chain link fences, split-rail fences, white picket fences, affordable and durable vinyl fencing, 6’ privacy fences, pool fences, and much more.
            <p>We’ve also handled many different types of entry methods and features. Whether you want self-closing hinges, a drive-through gate, a sliding barn door type-gate, a pet access point, or something else, just let us know.
            <p>Our most popular fencing style on Hilton Head Island is probably our beautiful vinyl fencing solutions. These can be fashioned to look like traditional wrought iron fences, or they can maintain a minimalistic modern look. They come in black, gray, white, and other colors as well. Additionally, we are able to finish these fences with a powder coating that makes them resistant to harsh weather, corrosion, scratches, and more.    
             </p>

            <h2>We Understand The Unique Challenges of Pool Fencing</h2>
            <p> Pool fences are not just decorative. In fact, pool fencing is mandatory under South Carolina law. You need the pickets and rails to be close enough together to prevent young kids from entering the pool area unattended, and in many cases, you need enough visibility to see through or over the fencing to keep an eye on swimmers. That said, you most likely want to allow plenty of sun into your pool area, and of course, you want the style of fence to nicely compliment your home, landscaping, and pool design. </p>
            <h3> Wooden, Metal, or Vinyl Pool Fence Installation in Hilton Head </h3>
          <p>
          We help residents of Hilton Head with all manner of pool fencing materials. If you would like a traditional wooden fence, we can speak with you about cost-effective pine, or more luxurious materials like redwood, cedar, or even exotic woods. We will need to seal and stain the wood periodically, and if you would like a coat of paint, that will require maintenance as well – wood can be susceptible to insects, rot, and exposure to sunlight. That said, we can install wooden pool fences with a picket design, ranch-style with mesh, privacy fence style, or other configurations.
          <p> Many homeowners in Hilton Head are choosing vinyl fencing – this material requires minimal maintenance, has lower up-front costs, and looks great. You don’t need to paint, seal or stain vinyl, and it even comes in a number of colors or wood imitation patterns.
          <p> Perhaps the fastest-growing pool fence option is aluminum. Aluminum doesn’t rust, can last for many decades, and can be sealed with a high quality powder coating in a number of colors. Like vinyl, it can also include a wood grain imitation
          <p> If you’d like to hear more about your pool fence options, give us a call! We would be happy to walk you through costs, longevity concerns, material availability, and more. </p>

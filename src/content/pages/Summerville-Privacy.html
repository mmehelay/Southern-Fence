            <h2>Benefits of Privacy Fencing</h2>
          
          <p>
       If allowed by your HOA or township, a privacy fence can dramatically improve your quality of life. You can shield your property and family from prying eyes, cut down on noise pollution, and better enjoy your patio, deck, lawn and pool. You can also reduce the risk of crime or trespassing with a privacy fence, and you won’t have neighboring dogs straying into your yard. If you call us to install a beautiful and high quality privacy fence on your property, both your curb appeal and home valuation will improve.</p>

              <h2>We Make The Consultation and Installation Easy</h2>
          <p>
   We’ve installed countless fences in Dorchester County, SC, and we have the process down to a science. We will walk the property, work with you on picking materials, height, and exact placement, and spec out any wiring or utilities. Then we dig the holes and install posts, anchoring them with concrete. Paneling or boards comes last, and we then seal, stain or finish the fence, depending on your material selection. The whole process can often be completed within a few days, and we won’t leave until it looks perfect.
            </p>

                       <h2>Styles and Material Options</h2>
          <p>
    We have experience with many different fencing materials, and we are happy to speak with you about the pros and cons of each. Vinyl is one of the most popular privacy fencing options on the market – it doesn’t require maintenance other than a periodic wash, and it comes with various color options, some of which mimic real wood. It also lasts for decades and can withstand the hot, moist climate of Summerville. Furthermore, it’s cost-effective.
          <p>Wood is a timeless option that will also be in high demand. We can seal or stain the wood to resist UV rays, moisture and bugs, and we can speak with you about the cost and benefits of different woods like pressure-treated pine, cedar, oak, and more. Aluminum is not a common material for privacy fences, but we have done semi-private fencing structures with aluminum materials. If you have any specific requests, let us know - we want you to love your fence. </p>


               <h2>Get a Durable Privacy Fence That Lasts For Decades</h2>
          <p>
 We only install high quality fences that will last for many years. As far as the materials themselves are concerned, vinyl privacy fences typically last the longest – you will often save money in the end when you choose vinyl. Redwood and cedar fences typically last longer than pine, but they are a bit more expensive. That said, we can increase the lifespan by staining the wood or applying a fresh seal every few years. We will speak with you about what to expect when we provide a quote.

            <h2> Working with Local Zoning Laws in Summerville, SC </h2>

            <p>In Summerville, we pay close attention to local zoning laws when installing privacy fences. These laws dictate the height, materials, and sometimes the style of fences allowed in different areas of the town. For example, certain neighborhoods may have restrictions on fence heights or require specific materials to maintain a consistent aesthetic. Our team promises compliance with these regulations, obtaining any necessary permits and working closely with local authorities to meet all legal requirements. </p>

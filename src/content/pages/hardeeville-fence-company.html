            <h2>We Have Experience With All Fencing Types</h2>
          <p>
          We’ve accumulated 15+ years of experience and scores of positive reviews by offering high quality work across numerous materials.<p>
            </p>

              <h3>Vinyl, Wood, Aluminum and More</h3>
          <p>
          Vinyl fencing, a popular choice in the Jasper County area, offers a versatile, low maintenance, and affordable option. Folks with acreage may not want to deal with the staining and painting associated with wood, and perhaps the cost of a high end aluminum fence isn’t desirable. Vinyl can always split the difference. We can present you examples of picket fencing styles, ranch styles, and other types of fences, and we can get the process started right away.<p>
            Many homeowners in Hardeeville still love wood fences - and we don’t blame them. We can install a minimal white picket fence made of wood, a heavy-duty farm fence with large posts and mesh, or even a rustic split-rail fence on your property. We can speak with you about wood types, their various benefits and drawbacks, and staining and finish options. <p>
                These days, many single-family homes look great with a modern aluminum fence. These can come in black, white, and even other colors, and the powder finish that gets electrostatically applied after installation will help the fence resist the elements for many years. These fences can either maintain a clean modern look, or be fashioned to imitate traditional iron fences and other designs.
            </p>

              <h3>All Manner of Access Points and Latches</h3>
          <p>
        Perhaps you need room for a tractor or ATV to pass through the gate, or maybe you want a classy walk-through gate for your fence. Let us know how you intend to use the entrance, and we’ll work with you to find and install the perfect hardware. If you only want to walk through the gate, you may want a self-closing hinge, but if you want to drive through the entrance, you may want a sliding gate, electronically controlled door, or something else entirely. Just let us know.
            </p>




               <h2>Attention To Detail At Each Step of The Fence Installation Process</h2>

              <h3>Get a Transparent Quote</h3>
          <p>
         Our commitment to excellence starts from the moment you contact us. We’ll schedule a visit, carefully inspect your property for rocky soil, plants that may be in the way, or other obstructions, and prepare a carefully itemized quote for your review. We can even let you know what the pricing differences among materials will be.
            </p>

              <h3>High Quality Materials</h3>
          <p>
       We have great relationships with all of our fencing material suppliers, and that allows us to get good deals on industry-leading vinyl, wood, aluminum, and other components. These savings, in turn, are passed on to you. From the wood we use to the hardware on your gate, we guarantee that your fence will last for many years to come.
            </p>

                <h3>Careful Digging and Anchoring</h3>
          <p>
      We won’t accidentally cut exterior lighting wires, burst a pipe, or dig an uneven line while installing your fence. We work meticulously and carefully. We also spend a considerable amount of time making sure that your fence is firmly anchored to the ground, even if you have sandy soil instead of the more standard red clay that South Carolina is known for.
            </p>

               <h3>Applying Coatings and Finishes</h3>
          <p>
      Depending on the style of fence you choose, you may want us to seal, stain, paint, or apply a powder coating to your fence. We paint fences for our fence installation customers, and we can even replace sections of any existing fencing structures (or replace rotting wood) while we are on-site.

            <h2>Wood Fence Installation in Hollywood</h2>
          <p>
            Wood fences are a timeless choice that always look great in South Carolina’s Lowcountry. From classic picket fences to a rustic ranch fence with wire mesh, give us a call.</p>


            <h3>White Picket Fences</h3>
              <p>
                The timeless look of a white picket fence is always in style. Perfect for framing front yards and gardens, a white picket fence adds a warm, welcoming feel to any property. It’s a choice that looks right at home in Hollywood’s friendly neighborhoods. Our picket fences are made from high-quality wood, painted to your preference, and built to last. Whether you want the classic low picket or a taller design for added presence, we have options that meet both traditional and modern tastes.
            </p>

            <h3> Privacy Fences</h3>
            <p> When privacy is a priority, a solid wood fence is the way to go. Our privacy fences provide seclusion, creating a peaceful retreat in your backyard. Built from sturdy wood panels, these fences block out unwanted views and cut down on noise, making your outdoor space feel like an extension of your home. You can choose from various heights and finishes to match your house and landscape. Our team builds each privacy fence to fit snugly around your property, giving you the peace of mind you deserve. </p>

            <h3> Ranch and Split Rail Fences</h3>
            <p> For larger properties or those with a more rural feel, ranch-style and split rail fences offer a touch of rustic charm. These fences are popular on farms and acreages but look just as lovely on a residential property. Ranch fences typically have horizontal rails and are great for defining property lines without blocking the view. Split rail fences provide a natural look with their rough-hewn wood rails and are a perfect choice for those who want a fence with a laid-back, country aesthetic. Both styles allow for an open feel while giving your property a defined boundary.</p>

            <h3> Metal Fence Installation in Hollywood, SC</h3>
            <p> If durability and elegance are what you’re after, our metal fences might be the perfect solution. Designed to withstand the elements, metal fences offer both beauty and strength. Southern Fence provides options in aluminum and wrought iron, two metals that are well-suited to Hollywood’s coastal weather while requiring minimal maintenance.</p>

            <h3> Aluminum Fences</h3> 
            <p> Aluminum fencing is a popular choice for its combination of style, resilience, and affordability. This type of fencing has the classic look of wrought iron but without the upkeep. Aluminum fences are lightweight, resistant to rust, and perfect for creating a sophisticated look around gardens, pools, and front yards. Available in a range of colors and styles, aluminum fencing works with nearly any home exterior. It’s a low-maintenance option that offers both security and beauty. </p>

            <h3> Wrought Iron Fences</h3> 
            <p> For those looking to make a statement, a wrought iron fence offers elegance that’s hard to match. These fences are known for their ornate designs and heavy-duty construction. Wrought iron fences add a sense of grandeur and timeless charm to any property. They’re ideal for front yards, gardens, and pools, offering strength and a high level of security. If you want to enhance your home’s curb appeal, a wrought iron fence can add a touch of sophistication that complements Hollywood’s beautiful landscape.</p>

            <h3> Chain Link Fence Installation in Hollywood, SC</h3> 
            <p> Chain link is popular for a reason - it lasts for decades, keeps costs relatively low, and stands up to South Carolina’s humid climate. We can even fit your chain link fence with privacy slats and gate operators - just let us know.</p>

            <h2> Gate Operators and Hand Gates</h2> 
            <p> A fence is only complete with the right gate. Southern Fence offers a wide range of gate options, from simple hand gates to advanced gate operators. Our hand gates are crafted to match the look and material of your fence, providing a seamless entryway that blends with the rest of your property. For added convenience, consider an automatic gate operator. These systems allow you to control your gate with the touch of a button, adding a layer of security and ease to your entryway. Whether you need a small garden gate or a grand driveway gate, we have options that make your property both accessible and secure.</p>

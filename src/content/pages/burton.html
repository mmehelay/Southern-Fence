                 <h2>Residential Fence Installation</h2>
                 <h3> Wood and Vinyl Privacy Fencing </h3>
            <p>
                A backyard fence can offer more peace of mind than most people expect. We install wood privacy fences that hold up in our extremely humid weather, and we typically use treated pine or cedar that we cut to fit perfectly. If you  don’t want to deal with regular staining or upkeep, vinyl is a solid alternative. It’s available in full privacy panels and picket styles, and it holds its color season after season.
            <p> If your yard has an uneven slope, narrow setbacks, or tight corners, that’s not a problem. We’ve built fences in just about every layout and will make sure your line stays clean and stable over time.        </p>

            <h3> Fencing for Pools and Decorative Use </h3>
                <p>
                    We install aluminum fencing around pools, patios, and garden spaces where people want structure without blocking the view. This material checks all the boxes for pool safety codes and gives a polished look around outdoor living areas. In front yards, vinyl or aluminum picket fencing offers a neat appearance with minimal upkeep.

                <p> If your neighborhood has design rules in place, we can help match the materials and height to what’s already approved. That way you don’t have to chase down the details. </p>

                <h3> Driveway Gates and Custom Features </h3>
            
            <p> We install walk-through and drive-through gates that match the rest of the fence, with latches, hinges, and posts built for everyday use. We also offer framed gates with added strength for wide openings or areas with heavy use. Decorative touches like post caps, lattice tops, or matching hardware are always available if you want to dress things up a bit.
            </p>



            <h2>Commercial Fence Installation</h2>
            <h3> Chain Link and Site Security </h3>
              <p>
                Southern Fence installs chain link fencing around storage yards, loading areas, government buildings, and other commercial properties in Burton. It’s one of the most reliable materials for large spaces and can be built with privacy slats or barbed wire when needed. We also install black vinyl-coated chain link for a cleaner, more finished look.
   <p>
    If your site needs gated entry, we’ll work with you on the right solution. That could mean a swing gate, a sliding gate, or an automatic system with keypad access.
            </p>
            <h3> Fencing for Apartment Properties and HOAs </h3>
            <p> We are happy to work with property managers who need fencing installed or replaced across larger communities. That includes vinyl fencing for patios, aluminum enclosures for pool areas, and secured trash corrals. We’re used to phasing out work so residents can come and go without disruption, and we keep communication open from start to finish. </p>

            <h2> We Know What Fences Last in Coastal South Carolina   </h2>
            <p> Our wood is pressure-treated, our aluminum is powder-coated, and our vinyl holds up against sun and rain without warping or fading. Posts are set deep and secured in concrete so the structure stays solid year after year.
            <p> We’ll explain what each material offers and help you decide what fits your goals and budget. Some clients want a classic wood fence. Others want something they can put in and forget about. Either way, we can make it work. </p>

            <h2> Local Fence Contractors Near You in the Burton Area  </h2>
            <p> We install fences throughout Beaufort County, including Laurel Bay, Shell Point, Port Royal, and Seabrook. We also take on jobs in Ridgeland, Yemassee, and other communities near the I-95 corridor. If you’re just outside town and wondering if we travel to your property, give us a call. Chances are, you’re within our regular routes.
            <p> When you work with Southern Fence, you’ll get a crew that shows up on time, keeps the job site clean, and builds fences that are meant to last. We’re local, we’re experienced, and we’re easy to work with. If you’ve got a fence in mind, we’d be happy to take a look and get you a quote. </p>

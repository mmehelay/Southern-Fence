            <h1 class="cs-title">Fence Company + Installation Experts in Beaufort, SC
            </h1>
            <p>
From the historic charm of Beaufort to the coastal-inspired beauty of Lady’s Island, we’ve installed fences in many colors, styles, and materials across the Port Royal Island area. We’ve worked with the owners of Antebellum mansions to install high end ornate aluminum fences, owners of coastal bungalows surrounded by Spanish moss to add quaint picket fences, country club residents to add safe and beautiful pool fences, and more. Whether you live near Laurel Bay or St. Helena Island, feel free to get in touch.            <p>
              We offer a complimentary consultation and quote to all interested clients, and we can set up a meeting at your residence as soon as possible. We would be happy to present samples, speak with you about your goals and budget, and start getting your fence installed right away.

            <h2>Choose Your Fence - We Do The Rest</h2>
          <p>
            Life is too short to install your own fencing system. We’ve worked on thousands of properties, and we are the Lowcountry’s go-to experts for fence installation. We will discuss your needs with you, order the materials, and carefully install an enclosure that will last for many years.   <p>
             Each fencing style has unique challenges that require expert skill. Wood fences need to be measured, anchored in such a way that the wood won’t rot or move, and sealed and stained or painted. Chain link fences must be purchased in the correct amounts, linked together with durable and reliable hardware, and finished according to the owner’s preference. Vinyl, while remaining one of the most popular choices on the market, requires specialized tools to cut and install – it also requires specialized experience to build the fence and anchor it. And aluminum needs a high end powder coating added via electrostatic application. 
            <p> All you need to do is let us know if you want a wood fence, metal fence, living fence, or other style, and we’ll handle every step of the process with minimal damage to your lawn.
            </p>


            <h2>Pools, Privacy Fences and Specialized Gates</h2>
              <p>
           In addition to traditional yard fencing installations in Beaufort, SC, we install vertical and horizontal privacy fences, pool fences (as required by SC law), and many different types of gates and entries. Some of our clients need large drive-in gates, while others want a double-wide opening in a chain link fence for ATVs, dirt bikes, or lawn equipment. From automated electronic gates to quaint hand operated gates with self-closing hinges, we can make your specific vision a reality.
   <p>
            Furthermore, if your fence idea requires HOA permission or a permit from the township, we can assist you with that. We can send over specific specifications for you to present, and if you do need a permit, we can make that as easy as possible. 
            <p> If you’re ready to receive your complimentary fence installation quote from our contractors, let us know! From iron fencing to composite fences and split-rail or ranch-style enclosures, we can help you perfect your outdoor space. We would love to hear from you.

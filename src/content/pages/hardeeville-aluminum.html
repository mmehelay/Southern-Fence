            <p>
Aluminum fences continue to grow in popularity in Hardeeville and elsewhere in the Lowcountry, and it’s not hard to see why. You can choose from traditional or contemporary fencing styles, and even wood-imitation materials. The aluminum will last for decades, you won’t have to repaint the surface, and it’s even resistant to rust and rot. It’s an incredible value, and you’ll love the look and durability of your new fence.

            <h2>Aluminum is an Excellent Choice For a Number of Reasons</h2>
   <h3> Enjoy 30+ Years of Longevity </h3>
          <p>
         Aluminum may not be quite as strong as steel, but unless you’re in a commercial area where cars will be bumping into your fence, aluminum is more than strong enough. It can withstand the sometimes severe weather of South Carolina’s coastal region, and it won’t rust, rot, or fall prey to insects. Because of its long lifespan, aluminum is genuinely one of the best values in the fencing market. With a professional installation from our team of experts, you can expect your aluminum fence to last for many decades.</p>

              <h3>Aluminum Fencing Doesn’t Require Regular Maintenance</h3>
          <p>
       Colors and finishes are applied to aluminum fences via a high tech powder coating, and this chip and scratch-resistant coating won’t need to be re-applied unless you want to change the fence’s color or replace damaged sections after a tree falls down, or something of that nature. You don’t have to paint, stain, or seal it, and you won’t have to replace individual pickets like you would with a pine fence.</p>

              <h3>Aluminum Fencing Comes in Many Styles</h3>
          <p>
    Believe it or not, you can replicate a traditional white picket fence, brown ranch-style fence, ornamental garden fence, or even wrought iron fence with aluminum materials. We can use spear caps or flat caps, shadow box fencing sections, and many other permutations. We would be happy to present you with recommendations for your landscape and the unique architecture of your home.
 </p>
        <h3> Professional Installation Will Improve Your Fence’s Lifespan </h3>
<p> The fencing material itself is high end, but our professional team of fence experts is even better. We’ll measure the property carefully, space the holes correctly, secure posts in the ground with cement, and attach each section of the fence with long-lasting hardware. You won’t need to worry about sections of your fence becoming loose or unreliable. We can even install the door or gate of your choice.

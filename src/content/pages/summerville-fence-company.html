            <h2>Get a Quick and Reasonable Quote on Your Project</h2>
          <p>
          We understand that by the time you call us, you are motivated to get your fencing project started. We’ll speak with you about your goals, offer insights over the phone or email, and schedule a visit to the property as soon as possible. During our walk-through, we’ll assess the terrain, ground conditions, obstructions, and more, and we can discuss materials and their various cost differences. Then we’ll create a personalized quote for you, and we can even send quotes for different styles of fencing within your budget.
            </p>

             <h2>We are the Local Fence Installation Experts</h2>

              <h3>Help Navigating Permits</h3>
          <p>
         While South Carolina has fewer fence permit laws than many states, you may need to pull permits in your town or county depending on the scope of the project. Front yards, back yards, and pools all have their own rules - we are happy to help you navigate this process.
            </p>

              <h3>Fences Covered By Insurance Companies</h3>
          <p>
       Did you lose your fence due to a hurricane, tropical storm, falling tree, or other event covered by insurance? We can provide a quote for you to share with your adjuster, and we can also be on-site when the adjuster visits your property. This can help ensure that the actual cost for replacement is covered by your home insurance.
            </p>

            <h3>Experience With Different Materials and Fencing Styles</h3>
          <p>
      We’ve installed countless chain link fences, white picket fences, unique iron fencing, aluminum fencing, and more. We even have experience with living fences – if you have any questions about the best fencing style for your property, we are happy to provide feedback! We can often send specific examples of past jobs.
            </p>




               <h2>A Variety of Fence Installation Services in Summerville, SC</h2>

              <h3>Metal and Aluminum</h3>
          <p>
        From chain link fences to aluminum fencing that imitates traditional wrought iron fences, we can install a beautiful or practical metal fence for you. These fences are durable, corrosion resistant, and come in a variety of colors and designs. We can also apply a powder coating to your metal fence – these help resist harsh coastal weather, provide multiple color options, and protect against chips and more.
            </p>

              <h3>Wood Fencing</h3>
          <p>
      From cedar to pine, redwood, and spruce, wooden fences are still popular among homeowners in the greater Charleston area. They will always be timeless and beautiful, even if they are more susceptible to the elements and pests than more modern solutions. We can install a wooden fence for you (picket, split rail and more), finish it with either paint or a stain, and help you with ongoing maintenance.
            </p>

                <h3>Vinyl Fencing</h3>
          <p>
     Vinyl is highly resistant to weathering, decay, and insect damage, and it maintains its appearance without the need for painting or staining. We have installed countless cost-effective vinyl fences for our clients, and we would love to help you find the perfect style and color within your budget.
            </p>

               <h3>Other Fences</h3>
          <p>
     Pool fences, high privacy fences, and even living fences are within our realm of expertise. We would love to work with you to find the right style of fence for your home, and since we have great relationships with our suppliers, we can have materials in very quickly.
            </p>

            <h3>Various Doors, Hatches, and Latches</h3>
          <p>
     Do you need a walk-through gate, a drive-through gate, or even a sliding gate for your fence? Do you want self-closing hinges, a keyed lock installed, gravity latches, or something else? Whether a car, ATV, or pet needs to pass through your fence gate, we can help by installing the perfect entry method for you.
            </p>

            </h1>
               <p>
           Southern Fence helps homeowners and commercial property managers install beautiful, functional, and long-lasting fences in Bluffton, SC. We take the natural beauty of Bluffton into consideration every time we undertake a project - whether you live in an Antebellum era home with a wide veranda or a charming cottage along the May River, we’ll help you identify and install the perfect fencing system within your budget.
   <p>
            We take things like topography and views into consideration as well. Many of our Bluffton-area clients border marshland, and some want their fence to perfectly integrate with sub tropical vegetation on their property or live oaks draped in Spanish moss.
            <p> Give us a call or send an email for your complimentary fencing quote. We can schedule a time to walk your property with you, and we can recommend different fencing styles and explain their pros and cons. We look forward to working with you.
            </p>
       
        
                 <h2>We Handle Every Kind of Fence in Bluffton</h2>
            <p>
As you consider potential enhancements to your property, the enduring resilience of its foundation becomes paramount, especially in Toronto's dynamic climate. Esk Waterproofing recognizes the weight of this consideration and the imperative for a concrete waterproofing solution that surpasses conventional measures.            </p>
                 <ul>
                <li>Vinyl fencing</li>
                <li>Wood fencing</li>
                <li>Aluminum fencing</li>
                <li>Chain link fences</li>
                <li>Composite fences</li>
                <li>Other metal fences</li>
            </ul>
                <p>
          Vinyl is the most common request these days, as it has tremendous longevity and flexibility. We can order your vinyl fence in a number of colors, and you won’t need to stain or seal the fence. Vinyl resists insects, rot, and other nuisances, and you can rely on your fence for years to come.
   <p>
            Aluminum is quickly growing in popularity because of its design flexibility, strength, and durability. We can apply a heavy duty powder coating to provide color, texture, and resistance to scratches and water, and you will love the high-end look of a black, white, or other aluminum fence. Aluminum can have a traditional picket fence style, horizontal privacy designs, ornate wrought iron imitation styles, and more - we can create any look or feel you have in mind.
            <p> Wood fencing is still popular in Bluffton, and we can use pressure-treated pine, long lasting cedar, or other high end wood products to create the perfect fence for you. We will measure the fence perfectly and add a layer of sealant, stain, or pain depending on your specific preference.
           <p> We also do many chain link fences, vertical privacy fences, composite fences, pool fencing and more in Beaufort County, SC, so please call if you have any questions.
            </p>



            <h2>New Homes, Established Landscapes, Insurance Rebuilds and More</h2>
              <p>
           We help general contractors by installing fences on new residential developments, current homeowners who want the perfect fence for their property, and residents who need to work with their insurance company to replace a fence that was damaged by trees, weather, or other insured causes. We can provide an itemized quote for your insurance adjuster to review, and we can show examples and mockups of how your fence will look if you are struggling to arrive at the right fencing style.

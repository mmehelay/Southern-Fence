            <h2>Chain Link Fence Coatings and Styles</h2>
          <p>
          You have many options at your disposal, and we would be happy to talk through them with you and present samples. The most common coatings are galvanized steel, which is steel coated with zinc to prevent rust, and vinyl-coated chain link, available in colors like black, green, or brown. These add a decorative touch while offering extra protection against the elements.
           <p> When it comes to style, the height and gauge (or thickness) of the chain link can vary. Residential fences typically range from 3 to 6 feet in height, whereas commercial properties might choose a taller fence for enhanced security. The gauge you choose affects the strength and durability of the fence - lower gauge numbers indicating thicker steel. Call us, and we’d be happy to offer our insight on what kind of fencing you might need, depending on the use case. </p>

             <h2>Chain Link Fence Installation Process and Time Frame</h2>

              <h3>The Process</h3>
          <p>
         Firstly, we’ll walk the property with you. We want to understand the topography, plants and soil condition, and the exact location you want your fence. We will also plot out utilities and power lines, and we always take local zoning laws into account. We then proceed to dig the post holes.
            <p> These holes are placed according to the layout plan and are typically about two feet deep, depending on the height of the fence and soil conditions. Each post hole is then filled with concrete – this concrete base is essential for the stability and longevity of the fence, especially in areas prone to high winds or stormy weather. The next step is to attach the chain link mesh to these posts. The mesh, made from interwoven steel wire, is attached to the posts using special wire ties or clips, and we stretch it carefully and tightly to make sure it doesn’t sag at all. We won’t leave until your fence looks perfect, and we are confident that it will last for many years.</p>

              <h3>The Time Frame</h3>
          <p>
      Typically, the time frame for a chain link fence installation is only a few days from start to finish. If you have a very long fence, or if you require specialty gates or excavation, it may take longer. But typically, it’s a non-invasive and quick process.
            </p>


               <h2>How Durable are Chain Link Fences?</h2>
               <p> Galvanized chain link fences can last about 20 years or more, while vinyl-coated fences often have a longer lifespan due to the added layer of protection against weathering. Regular maintenance, like washing the fence with soapy water to remove dirt and debris, can extend its life. We will speak with you about how to preserve the life span of your chain link fencing, especially considering the challenging weather and soil conditions in South Carolina’s lowcountry. </p>



            <h2>Types of Chain Link Gates and Other Options </h2>
              <h3>Your Gates of Choice</h3>
          <p>
        We’ve worked with many chain link fence gates types, from walk-through pedestrian gates to larger drive-through gates for tractors and ATVs. The size and type of gate will depend on the intended use and the space available.
         <p> If you want greater convenience and security, we can talk about advanced gate options like remote-operated or automatic gates. Many homeowners find this added expense to be well worth it, as it improves home valuation and improves your quality of life.   </p>

              <h3>Customization and Additional Features</h3>
          <p>
     Property owners can add privacy slats, windscreens, or other features for additional privacy and wind protection. If you need to secure a commercial property with barbed wire, razors, or have any other specific specialty requests, let us know! We have a tremendous amount of experience with different property types.

            <h2>We Build and Install All Kinds of Fences</h2>
          <p>
           We’ve installed hundreds, if not thousands, of fences, and we can work with all manner of designs, use cases and materials. If you have a particular style of fence in mind, let us know - we are also happy to help you choose by showing examples and explaining the pros and cons of different finishes. <p>
            </p>

              <h3>Wood Fences in Okatie</h3>
          <p>
          Many of the charming homes in Okatie still have traditional picket fences; it’s hard to replace the timeless look of real wood. We can speak with you about the price and longevity differences between cedar and pressure-treated pine, your options regarding sealants, stains, and paints, and how your fence will hold up against the hot Low Country sun and potential for storms. <p>
            </p>

              <h3>Metal and Aluminum</h3>
          <p>
          Homeowners in Okatie often have space for large dogs, ATVs, or even tractors, and this makes a rugged chain link fence a great fit for many properties. We can measure the amount of fence you need, provide an accurate quote, and get the fence installed as soon as our materials arrive. We have great relationships with our suppliers, and we can often pass those cost and time savings along to you. We have also installed a large number of modern aluminum fences in the last several years. These are versatile because they can imitate the look of very traditional iron fences or modern fences, and they need very little maintenance after we apply the powder coating. You also have color choices with aluminum.<p>
            </p>

              <h3>Vinyl Fencing installation</h3>
          <p>
           Vinyl fences resist pests, don’t rot, and won’t rust, so if you want a durable and worry-free fence, ask us about vinyl. The up front costs are marginally higher than wood, since we will need to use specialized tools and techniques and order your high quality vinyl fencing materials (we only use high quality vinyl). But after that, the long term savings are hard to beat. You’ll be able to choose different designs and colors, and your fence will last for many years without rotting.
            </p>

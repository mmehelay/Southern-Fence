            <h2>Local Fencing Expertise</h2>
          <p>
            Walterboro has its own charm and landscape, and we think fences should be treated in kind. We install fences that improve your property’s curb appeal while still offering the functionality you need. We also know the challenges of South Carolina’s Lowcountry -  humid weather, sandy soil, and seasonal tropical storms will wreak havoc on a weak or untreated fence. We won’t let that happen to you.</p>
            <p> We serve Walterboro and nearby communities like Cottageville, Ruffin, and Canadys, and whether you need a new fence for your home, business, or farm, please get in touch. </p>
            <h2>Wood Fence Installation in Walterboro</h2>
            <p> Who doesn’t love a wood fence? Whether you want a privacy fence for your backyard or a decorative picket fence to frame your front yard, we can help you pick the right type of wood or configuration. We’ll also prime and paint/stain the fence, and we can also install wire mesh if desired. We can also help you choose from pine, cedar, redwood, and other types of wood materials. </p>
            <h3>Privacy Fence Installation</h3>
              <p>
                A tall, solid wood privacy fence turns your yard into a personal retreat. They block both the line of sight and unwanted noise, and we can custom-build to fit your property’s layout. You can also use metal materials for a privacy fence, and we have contemporary options to show you, if that’s more along the lines of what you need. We’ll always work within local zoning laws on privacy fences.
            </p>

            <h3> Decorative Picket Fences</h3>
            <p> Whether you prefer a natural wood finish or a painted white design, picket fences are a wonderful way to highlight gardens, walkways, and driveways. And did you know that you can choose different styles? Get a Georgian Point picket fence, Turned Greek Revival, or even a Shapely Victorian style. It’s up to you. </p>

            <h3> Ranch-Style Fencing</h3>
            <p> For larger properties or farms, ranch-style fences are an attractive and practical choice. The rustic aesthetic is perfect for rural properties, or those with acreage. We can also add wire mesh to keep animals in or out of your property.</p>

            <h2> Metal Fencing in Walterboro </h2>
            <h3> Aluminum Fences </h3>
            <p> Aluminum fencing is gaining popularity. Resistant to rust and corrosion, aluminum is a great option for our humid climate. Enclose pools, gardens, or your front yard while requiring little to no maintenance. Furthermore, aluminum fencing is available in almost any color and style imaginable, including imitation wood grain patterns or wrought iron imitation patterns.</p>

            <h3>Wrought Iron Fences</h3>
            <p> We can source a spectacular and ornate wrought iron fence for you and install it. You can add a small garden fence or a tall fence around the perimeter of your property – give us a call and we’ll discuss details. </p>

            <h2> Chain Link Fence Installation in Walterboro, SC </h2> 
            <p> Chain link is affordable, durable, and practical, and it works well for residential, commercial, and agricultural properties. We install chain link fences all the time, and we can even add gates and privacy. It’s no big deal for us to add slats over the chain link, or include a gate with either a hand operator or electric operator. </p>
            <h2> Choose Southern Fence </h2> 
            <p> We have many years of experience, and we love helping our clients transform their properties. We also have excellent relationships with our fencing material suppliers, and we pass that value on to our customers. If you’d like a quote on your fencing project, please get in touch.</p>

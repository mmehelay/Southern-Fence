            <h2>Aluminum Fences are Flexible in Terms of Style and Finish</h2>
   <h3> Nearly Any Fencing Style </h3>
          <p>
         Aluminum fencing is available in nearly any style, both traditional and contemporary. Get a classic white picket fence, only instead of wood, enjoy the durability of aluminum. You can also get an imitation wrought iron fence, or install shadow box effects, dog-eared fencing, modern privacy panels, or a ranch-style fence to allow lots of sunlight and visibility. We can also install ornamental aluminum fences around your garden, yard, or other parts of your home.</p>

              <h2>Different Colors and Finishes</h2>
          <p>
        One of the significant advantages of aluminum fencing is the variety of finishes available. Powder coating is a popular finish that not only adds color but also provides a durable layer of protection against the elements. This finish comes in many colors, from black or white to red and burnt orange – there’s  a finish to suit almost any style of home or landscape. Aluminum fences can also feature finishes that mimic the texture and appearance of wood. This is an amazing option for homeowners who don’t want to deal with sealing, staining and painting every couple of years.</p>

              <h3>Aluminum Fences Can Last For a Long Time</h3>
          <p>
    Unlike iron or steel, aluminum does not deteriorate when exposed to moisture, making it an excellent choice for properties near the ocean. The powder coating finish further increases its durability, protecting the fence from UV rays, scratches, and fading. This rust-free material is particularly helpful in Hilton Head’s humid climate, and the added strength of metal will help you when the next hurricane comes along.

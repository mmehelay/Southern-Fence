            <h2>We Install All Fence Types</h2>
          <p>
            We’re versatile in terms of fencing materials and styles. We’ve installed ranch fences, wrought iron fences, privacy fences, pool fences, and more. Just give us a call and we’ll get started.</p>
            

              <h3>Wood Fence Installation in Ridgeland, SC</h3>
          <p>
            Wood fences look good almost anywhere. Whether you prefer a rustic split rail fence or the privacy of a tall board-on-board design, we can work with wood. We are often asked for classic picket fences, shadow box styles with alternating panel design, ranch fencing with mesh, and many other types of fences. We’ll install the fence, and we often finish by priming and painting wood fences. If you need help with maintenance after a few years, we do help previous customers by repairing and painting existing fences that we have installed. <p>
            </p>

              <h3>Vinyl Fencing</h3>
          <p>
            For homeowners seeking low-maintenance fencing that still looks great, vinyl is a great choice. Vinyl fences resist weathering, so you won’t need to worry about repainting or staining. Whether you choose a privacy fence, lattice top, or even a picket style, vinyl fences offer durability and come in a variety of colors to suit your style. You’d be amazed at the vinyl fences that imitate natural materials – and they look great.
            </p>

              <h3>Wrought Iron and Aluminum Metal Fences in Ridgeland</h3>
          <p>
            Does anything beat a traditional wrought iron fence? Wrought iron fences provide an elegant appearance that boosts curb appeal while keeping your property safe. Aluminum fencing offers a strong and sleek look without the maintenance required by iron. Get spear-top, flat-top, or decorative ironwork to add character to your home. These fences usually come with powder-coated finishes for added durability. We’d be happy to show you a number of examples and design options if you’re interested in a metal fence.
            </p>



            <h3>Chain Link Fence Installation</h3>
              <p>
                Do you need to contain a pet, keep your kids safe from wandering into the street, or protect your vehicles and ATVs? Call us about a cost-effective and durable chain link fence. We can also add a convenient hand gate, and we even install powered double gates and other operators.
            </p>

            <h3> Privacy Fencing </h3>
            <p> Whether you want a tall wood fence, a vinyl option with no gaps, or even a hybrid of the two with overlapping panels, enjoy incredible privacy and safety in your backyard. Styles include stockade, board-on-board, tongue-and-groove, and more, so you can still have a beautiful fence while prioritizing your privacy. </p>

            <h3> Pool Fencing </h3>
            <p> We install pool fences that meet local regulations while complementing your landscaping and home. Options like aluminum fencing, glass panels, or vinyl fences give you some flexibility regarding your pool fence. </p>
        
            <h2> Our Process </h2>
            <p> Southern Fence makes it as easy as possible for you to get a durable fence installed. Firstly, just give us a call or fill out a form. Feel free to share as much information about your goals, design preferences and budget as possible. Then, we’ll schedule a time to visit the property and take measurements. We will also look for any challenges, like rocks, awkwardly placed trees, and more.            </p>
            <p> We then discuss your material preferences with you and deliver an accurate quote. Once you’ve approved the quote, we’ll set a date for the installation, and ahead of that time, we will source the materials and hardware, measure the fence perfectly, and prepare for a quick and painless installation. </p>

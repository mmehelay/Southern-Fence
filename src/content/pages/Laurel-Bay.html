            <h2> Types of Fence We Work With </h2>
            <p> Our skilled contractors are comfortable working with all kinds of materials to help you achieve the desired look for your fence. </p>

            <h3> Wood Fence Installation in Laurel Bay </h3>
            <p> Cedar is popular for its natural resistance to decay and insects. Pine, often treated with preservatives, offers affordability and durability. Redwood provides a beautiful finish and longevity. Cypress is another excellent choice because it resists rot and insect damage, making it ideal for outdoor use. </p>

            <h3> Aluminum Fences in Laurel Bay </h3>
            <p> Aluminum fences are nice because they are lightweight and durable, and they offer an affordable option. Their ability to resist rust and corrosion make them a great choice for all kinds of different climates, and aluminum fences increase the aesthetic of the house with their sleek, modern look. Additionally, aluminum fences are available in multiple styles, and they can be painted many different colors, making them versatile and adaptable for every house.  </p>

            <h3> Vinyl Fencing Installation  </h3> 
            <p> Vinyl fences, which offer many benefits, are desired because they are resistant to rot, pests, and even water damage. These fences require very little to no maintenance, and they are easy to clean using just soap and water. You don’t even need to paint. Vinyl fences are also versatile because they come in different styles and match many houses. </p>

            <h3> Chain Link Fences and More </h3> 
            <p> Chain link fence is affordable, durable, and, once again, requires minimal maintenance. Their security and visibility make them ideal for residential and commercial settings.

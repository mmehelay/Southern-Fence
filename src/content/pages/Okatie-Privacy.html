            <h2>What Kinds of Privacy Fence Can You Install?</h2>
            <p> Simply put, we can install any kind of privacy fence. But you do have options. We’ll speak with you about your budget, your preferred look, the materials you like, and how these materials will stand up to the challenging and humid lowcountry climate.  </p>
            
          


              <h3>Wooden Privacy Fences</h3>
          <p>
   Many homeowners in Okatie go with pressure treated pine, and due to the treatment of the lumber, this wood stands up to insects, moisture and rot. We would stain or paint this for you, and you could enjoy a long lasting fence with minimal upkeep.
           <p> Cedar and redwood, among other types of luxury woods, are more naturally beautiful and resistant to pests. We would be happy to give you pricing information about these options, and whether you want to keep the natural color, enhance it with a stain, or paint the wood, we are happy to help. </p>

    

           <h3> Can You Get a Metal Privacy Fence?</h3>
           <p> Anything is possible these days. We’ve installed many iron and steel fences, but aluminum is generally the best choice for homeowners in Okatie. It doesn’t rust, is lightweight, and we can create a privacy fence by installing attractive panels with minimal spacing. Furthermore, aluminum comes in all manner of finishes and even wood-mimicking designs.</p>

              <h3> Vinyl Privacy Fences</h3>
           <p> Made from high-quality PVC, vinyl is another popular choice for privacy fences. We can order panels, slats or pickets for you, and you can choose from bold colors, traditional white, or a finish that looks like natural materials.Vinyl is easy to clean, doesn’t splinter or chip, and will last for many years despite its affordable price tag.</p>

    <!--Download the pin icon, in Figma create a 1920x600 rectangle and make its background a screenshot of the Google Maps location of your clients business location, make sure their actual location is at the center. Doesn't have to be EXACT. Then add the pin in Figma and absolutely position it where its location is in the map.  Highlight everything and hit CTRL G to group it, then export that section as a png.

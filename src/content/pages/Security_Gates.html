            <h1 class="cs-title">Security Gate Installation</h1>        
          <p>
            Southern Fence installs security gates for commercial and industrial sites across Charleston, Bluffton, Hilton Head, Beaufort, and nearby areas. These gates limit access, regulate traffic, and protect what’s inside the fence, and whether your property needs a simple swing gate or a fully automated entry system, we help you choose the right solution based on usage and risk level. </p>
        <p> We work with business owners, general contractors, municipal departments, and facility managers to build gate systems that operate smoothly and last in tough conditions. From logistics yards to school campuses, we adapt to the site and deliver systems that work day in and day out.
        <p> Call Southern Fence for a complimentary site evaluation and quote on your project, and keep your staff, employees and equipment safer. </p>

            <h2> Types of Security Gates We Install</h2>
            <h3> Swing, Slide, and Cantilever Gates            </h3>
              <p> Gate type depends on traffic flow and available space. Swing gates are best for properties with room to open fully in one direction. Slide gates are a better fit when space is limited or when the gate needs to open alongside a fence line. Cantilever and vertical lift gates are often used on industrial sites or uneven terrain where ground movement or drainage makes track systems unreliable.
            <p> We size and install gates based on your daily operations. That includes entry points for cars, commercial trucks, and emergency vehicles. </p>

            <h3> Pedestrian Access Gates  </h3>
            <p> Many commercial properties also need secure pedestrian gates, either at staff entrances or alongside vehicle lanes. These gates often require different hardware, height, and access control features. We help design and install these systems as part of the larger perimeter.</p>

            <h2> Manual and Automatic Gate Systems            </h2>
            <h3> Manual Gates With Secure Locking            </h3>
            <p> Manual gates still serve many properties well. They are often the right choice for low-traffic entrances, small parking lots, or storage yards that stay locked after hours. We install heavy-duty manual gates with commercial-grade hinges, posts, and secure locking systems. </p>
       
           

            <h3> Automatic Gates With Access Control </h3>
            <p> For sites that need frequent or timed access, we install operator-driven gates with automated features. These may include keypads, remotes, card readers, intercom systems, safety loops, and magnetic locks. We match the automation system to your needs, whether it's for shift scheduling, delivery windows, or visitor entry. </p>


            <h2> Code Compliance and Safety Requirements  </h2>
            <h3> Meeting Local and National Standards </h3>
            <p> Gate systems must comply with both safety codes and local zoning. We install access systems that meet national standards for automated gate safety, including required sensors, warning signs, and manual override systems. If your site is in an area with specific visibility or setback rules, we make sure the gate layout is compliant before work begins. </p>
            <h3> Visual Requirements for Gated Entries            </h3>
            <p> Some communities like Hilton Head or Mount Pleasant have strict appearance guidelines. In those cases, we offer matching finishes, colors, and material options that meet the requirements while still providing long-term durability. </p>

            <h2>Integrating Gates With Perimeter Fencing  </h2> 
            <h3> Gate and Fence Compatibility            </h3>
            <p> We build gates that work as part of a complete fencing system. That means planning gate placement to avoid pinch points, traffic delays, or security gaps. We also match gate height, style, and post materials to the rest of your fence so that everything functions and looks like one system. </p>

            <h3> Layout and Site Considerations  </h3>
            <p> Every site is different. Some gates need to operate near a slope, retention pond, or setback line. Others require stormwater accommodations or wider entries to allow for delivery truck movement. We assess these issues during the planning phase so there are no surprises after installation. </p>

            <h2> Service Area: Lowcountry Security Gate Installers  </h2>
            <p> Southern Fence installs commercial and industrial gates across Charleston County, Beaufort County, Jasper County, and Colleton County. We regularly work in Mount Pleasant, North Charleston, Bluffton, Hilton Head, Beaufort, Port Royal, Hardeeville, Ridgeland, and surrounding areas. </p>
            <p> Gate systems in this region need to hold up to coastal weather, high humidity, and in some cases, salt air or flooding risk. We build with materials and equipment that are suited to these conditions so you don’t run into premature wear or failure. </p>

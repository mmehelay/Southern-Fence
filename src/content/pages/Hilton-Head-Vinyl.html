            <h2>Vinyl Fencing Comes in All Shapes and Sizes</h2>
          
            
          <p>
        The versatility of vinyl allows for privacy fences with solid panels, picket fences that add charm without obstructing views, shadowbox styles to provide a semi-private option that allows air circulation without obstructing direct views, and more. We can even install lattice and scalloped designs if you’d like an elegant solution. Vinyl coloring options include tan, gray, and even simulated wood patterns, along with the traditional white. If you have a different color in mind, let us know!</p>

              <h2>Vinyl Stands Up To Hilton Head's Coastal Climate</h2>
          <p>
    Unlike wood or metal, vinyl does not rust, rot, or suffer termite damage. It withstands the salty air and humidity that characterize coastal environments, and it maintains its integrity and appearance over time. Vinyl's resilience to the sun's UV rays prevents it from fading, which is particularly beneficial during Hilton Head’s summers. Homeowners will appreciate how vinyl fences require minimal upkeep, and they need only occasional cleaning with soap and water to keep them looking new. If you’re too busy to handle staining and painting every few years, go with vinyl - you’ll love the worry-free fence.
            </p>

                       <h2>What Coatings are Available For Vinyl?</h2>
          <p>Some vinyl fences come with a UV-resistant coating to ensure that the vibrant color of the fence endures despite prolonged exposure to sunlight. Anti-mildew coatings are also available, preventing the growth of mold and mildew, which can be a concern in Hilton Head's humid climate. Unlike wood, aluminum, and other fencing styles, we usually don’t need to add any particular coatings to the vinyl fence after we install it.</p>

    <!--Download the pin icon, in Figma create a 1920x600 rectangle and make its background a screenshot of the Google Maps location of your clients business location, make sure their actual location is at the center. Doesn't have to be EXACT. Then add the pin in Figma and absolutely position it where its location is in the map.  Highlight everything and hit CTRL G to group it, then export that section as a png.

            <h2>Pool Fence Materials Available</h2>
            <h3> Aluminum Pool Fences </h3>
          <p>
          Aluminum is durable, easy to maintain, and resistant to corrosion – this is especially important in the humid climate of Summerville. Thes fences offer a clean, modern look and can be powder-coated in various colors to match your home's exterior. We can also find a pool fence in the style of your choice, from picket to privacy or ranch-style. </p>

              <h3>Vinyl Pool Fences in Summerville</h3>
          <p>
        Vinyl is the most popular choice for pool fences, since they last for decades and come in a variety of colors. You don’t have to paint or seal vinyl, and we can use panels for privacy, pickets for a classic look, or horizontal rails.</p>

              <h3>Wrought Iron Pool Fences</h3>
          <p>
      While wrought iron requires more rust-prevention work, and it can cost more up front, the classic elegance of a wrought iron fence around your pool or spa area is unparalleled. For more information about designs or availability, give us a call.
            </p>


               <h3>Wood Pool Fences</h3>
               <p> Wood will never go out of style. From pine and cedar to redwood and other tropical woods that resist water, we can help you choose a wood pool fence that will meet your needs. We can seal and/or stain the wood, and it will look spectacular. </p>



            <h2>Design Options For Your Pool Fence</h2>
     
          <p>
The design of your pool fence should balance looks and function. The height of the fence is an important consideration for safety; most local laws require pool fences to be at least 4 feet tall. Some homeowners choose higher fences for added privacy and security as long as HOAs and local laws allow.
         <p> The spacing between the fence slats or pickets is another crucial design aspect. To prevent small children and pets from squeezing through, the gaps should not exceed 4 inches. For those seeking more privacy, solid panel vinyl or wooden fences might be the preferred option, while aluminum or wrought iron fences are ideal for those who want a balance of safety and unobstructed views of their pool area. </p>

            <h2>Our Privacy Fences in Hardeeville Stand the Test of Time</h2>
          
            
          <p>
      The South Carolina lowcountry is subject to wind, high levels of moisture, and the occasional severe storm. Our fences can weather most storms. For wood fences, we use wood that is naturally resistant to rot and pest damage, such as cedar or pressure-treated pine, and we then treat them with UV-resistant sealants. For vinyl and composite fences, we use high-grade products known for their UV stability and mold resistance.
       <p> Our privacy fence installation methods are also designed for longevity. We set fence posts in concrete, use hardware and fasteners that are anti-corrosive, and fit each panel into place perfectly so you won’t have gaps and ugly seams. </p>

              <h2>We Handle All Privacy Fence Materials</h2>
          <p>
 From wood to aluminum, vinyl and composite, we work with you to find the perfect material that suits your budget, maintenance concerns, aesthetic preferences, HOA requirements, and the local weather. We are happy to recommend certain woods that will stand up to insects and rot after treatment, and we can also make a privacy fence out of aluminum panels or even pickets – we can create privacy by fitting pickets closer together.
         <p> Furthermore, due to our excellent relationship with our suppliers, we are able to pass the value on to our customers. We have competitive and fair pricing, and you won’t work with a higher quality privacy fence installer in Hardeeville.

                       <h2>Call or Email For a Free Quote</h2>
          <p>We would love to speak with you about your desired privacy fence, walk the property line, and give you an accurate and transparent quote. We are confident that you’ll love your fence, and that it will serve you for many years.</p>

    <!--Download the pin icon, in Figma create a 1920x600 rectangle and make its background a screenshot of the Google Maps location of your clients business location, make sure their actual location is at the center. Doesn't have to be EXACT. Then add the pin in Figma and absolutely position it where its location is in the map.  Highlight everything and hit CTRL G to group it, then export that section as a png.  Now you have your map graphic made for your client. Make an 800X1000 center crop of the image to load on mobile. Then remove this img tag for the icon. -->

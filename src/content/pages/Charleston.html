            <h2>Types of Fences We Can Install</h2>
          <p>
            A fence isn’t just a boundary marker. It can be a defining feature of your outdoor space, and give your home  character and purpose. Our company offers a broad selection of fencing materials, styles, and designs to match your vision. We work with everything from wooden fences to metal options, and we install everything with care and craftsmanship. We also understand that Charleston’s unique charm deserves a fence that can stand up to the coastal weather while looking good year-round. Get in touch for your complimentary estimate - we’d love to hear from you.</p>


            <h3>Wood Fencing Installation</h3>
              <p>
                We offer various types, colors, and styles to suit your preferences, including picket, ranch, and split rail designs. The beauty of wood fencing is in its versatility. If you prefer a traditional look, a white picket fence might be perfect. If you need something to frame a larger property, a ranch-style fence can provide that open and rustic feel. Split rail fences add charm to both large and small properties, while taller wooden fences offer more privacy. With the right stain or paint, a wood fence can be customized to match your home’s exterior. Plus, wood has a warmth that other materials can’t quite match, making it a favorite for many residents in the South Carolina lowcountry.
            </p>

            <h3> Pool and Privacy Fence Installation in Charleston, SC</h3>
            <p> A privacy fence around your yard or pool area can create a personal oasis away from prying eyes, so call us to turn your backyard into a private and comfortable space.  Pool fencing, on the other hand, isn’t just about privacy; it’s about safety too. If you have children or pets, a secure pool fence is an excellent investment for added protection. We install privacy fences in several materials, including wood and vinyl, each offering a blend of durability and style. Pool fences, designed specifically with safety in mind, come in a range of designs that maintain visibility while creating a secure barrier. </p>

            <h3> Chain Link Fences</h3>
            <p> Chain link fencing is known for its durability and low maintenance, and that’s what makes them an ideal solution for both residential and commercial spaces. They’re perfect for pet enclosures, defining property lines, and securing larger areas. Available in different heights and coated in colors like green or black, chain link fences can be customized to blend into the background or stand out, depending on your preference. We also offer privacy slats, which can be added to chain link fences to give you more seclusion while retaining the fence’s functionality.</p>

            <h3> Wrought Iron, Aluminum, and Other Metal Fencing</h3>
            <p> Wrought iron and aluminum fences offer elegance and strength that other materials can’t promise. These fences are ideal for homeowners looking to add a touch of classic charm to their property. Wrought iron fences, with their intricate designs and sturdy frames, can give any property a distinguished look. Aluminum fencing provides a similar aesthetic at a more affordable price point and requires less maintenance, making it a great alternative. These metal fences are excellent for security, adding curb appeal, and offering a long-lasting boundary around your property. They’re also highly customizable, allowing you to choose from various styles and finishes. </p>

            <h3> Gates and Gate Operators </h3> 
            <p> Every great fence deserves a great gate. Whether you’re looking for a simple entry gate or a more elaborate automated option, we have the expertise to install gates that match your fence style and add convenience to your property. We offer a variety of gate types, including swing gates, sliding gates, and rolling gates, each with the option of an operator for easy access. Automatic gates are a popular choice for homeowners who want added security and convenience. With a gate operator, you can control access to your property with the touch of a button, making it both secure and user-friendly. From wood gates to wrought iron and chain link options, we’ll help you find the perfect entry solution. </p>

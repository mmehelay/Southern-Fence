            <h2>There Are Many Wooden Fence Options To Choose From</h2>
            <p> You have so many types of wooden fences to choose from, each suited for a different budget, use-case, and aesthetic. Let us talk you through your options and find the perfect fit.
                <p> Many of our customers request picket fences, which mesh well with the types of homes you find in Bluffton. We install traditional white picket fences as well as more contemporary takes – feel free to vary the picket height, add decorative topics like rounded edges and gothic points, or even lattice sections to create an elegant and semi-transparent look.
                    <p> Split rail fences are another popular choice for larger properties. The rugged, rough-hewn logs settle into the landscape beautifully, and they can either contain animals or simply set apart your property. Along those lines, ranch fences, with or without wire between the posts, is a great choice for homeowners with large properties.
                        <p> Our <a href="/Bluffton"> fence installation company in Bluffton </a> is also happy to add a privacy fence to your property, and we always keep local codes and HOA rules in mind. </p>  
            <h2>Wood Types For All Uses and Budgets </h2>
   
          <p>
       Many of our customers go for pressure-treated pine or spruce, since it’s affordable, durable, and receives paint or stain nicely. We can also install a cedar fence on your property - these fences are naturally gorgeous, and they are more resistant to the elements, bugs and decay. You won’t need to treat the wood as often, and it does look higher-end.
<p>More exotic woods like redwood are at the higher end of the spectrum, and while not very common in South Carolina, a redwood fence is an amazing opportunity to stand out in your neighborhood.
<p> 
All things considered, we will want to have a conversation about your goals, style preferences, and budget – we can help you choose the right kind of wood.
 </p>

              <h2>We Finish and Paint Our Wooden Fences in Bluffton</h2>
          <p>
We aren’t done until your fence is perfect. If we find a piece of lumber that looks structurally inferior, we’ll replace it with a new one before we are finished. We will then make sure the wood is clean and sanded, apply primer and paint, or use a beautiful stain that naturally enhances the fence’s wood grain and texture. We are happy to present you with samples so that you can choose the right color or finish.

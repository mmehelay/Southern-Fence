            <h2>We Work With Many Fencing Materials</h2>
          <p>
            Picking the right fencing material is one of the first steps in your project, and Yemassee’s weather, landscape, and your personal needs will play a big role in that decision. The good news is that there are materials for nearly every use-case and budget. If you need some ideas, feel free to get in touch.</p>
            

              <h3>Wood Fence Installation</h3>
          <p>
            Despite the humid weather, wood fences will always be popular in South Carolina. They look beautiful, come in many designs, and always complement a Lowcountry property. Pine can be treated to resist pests and weather, cedar naturally repels bugs, and redwood fencing immediately increases your home’s property value. From a classic picket fence to a tall privacy fence, we can make it with wood.</p>
            

              <h3>Metal Fencing</h3>
          <p>
            For something a little more long term, metal fencing is a good option. Aluminum fencing is lightweight, low-maintenance, and can give off the look of wrought iron without the hassle. It’s a great option for both decorative front yards and pool areas. If you want the real deal, wrought iron offers timeless beauty and added security, though it does require occasional maintenance to prevent rust. We are happy to walk you through treatment and maintenance options.
            </p>
            <p> For those who just need something simple and effective, chain link fencing is always on the table. We can install chain link fences of varying heights in Yemassee, and we can also add gates and gate operators. </p>

              <h3>Vinyl Fencing</h3>
          <p> If you want as little maintenance as possible, vinyl fencing is the way to go. Resistant to weather and wear, vinyl comes in a variety of colors and styles to match your home. Whether you need privacy or just want to define your property lines, vinyl fences last for years without needing to be repainted or repaired.  </p>
          


            <h2>What Fence Style Fits Your Property?</h2>
              <p>
                For many open properties in Yemassee or neighboring areas like Pocotaligo and Gardens Corner, ranch or split rail fencing fits right in with the Lowcountry feel. These fences are great for marking boundaries while keeping an open and natural look. If you have animals, we can also add wire mesh to your ranch-style wood fence.
            </p>
            <p> Looking for something more traditional? Go with a picket fence. They look good around nearly every front yard and garden, and you can get a picket fence in wood, vinyl, or even aluminum.</p>
            <p> Ornamental fences are another great option if you want to add “something extra” to your property. Whether you want wrought iron or aluminum, you can make a bold statement while maintaining privacy and security.             </p>

            <h2> Privacy and Pool Fencing in Yemassee</h2>
            <p> We install many pool fences and privacy fences in South Carolina. Our pool fences can be vinyl, chain link, aluminum, or even a glass panel fencing system. Privacy fences are more varied than you might think – we are happy to share many examples of designs and materials for you to choose from.</p>

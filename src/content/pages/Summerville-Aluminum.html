            <h2>Aluminum Fences Are Remarkably Durable</h2>
   
          <p>
         While aluminum can cost a bit more than wood up front, the return on your investment will be worth it. Aluminum can last for many decades. Unlike iron, aluminum does not rust, making it ideal for the humid climate of Summerville - the fence will remain strong and beautiful  over time. Furthermore, aluminum fences withstand UV rays, rain and other environmental factors, so your risk of warping and fading is quite low. You won’t have to worry about replacing rotten boards, repainting or restaining your fence.</p>

              <h2>Aluminum Fences Come in Many Styles</h2>
          <p>
        Do you want the classic look and feel of a picket fence? We can order aluminum fencing pickets that mimic the traditional wood version - only it will last decades longer. Or do you want a rustic ranch-style fence with horizontal rails? We can make that happen as well. We can also install aluminum panels to create a privacy fence, install wrought iron-imitation fences with ornate designs, and more. Let us know what your preferences are – we are happy to show you samples and ideas.</p>

              <h3>Durable Finishing Options</h3>
          <p>
      Aluminum fences are finished with a powder coating that protects the fence from abrasions, moisture, UV rays, rust and more. We can use any number of colors and textures, and if the fence needs a touch-up in a decade or two, it’s easy to have a new powder coat added. The powder coating is electromagnetically applied, and the dry powder is placed under heat to form a protective skin on the aluminum.

Wood materials make for a beautiful fence, and many homeowners can’t let go of the character associated with a rustic split rail enclosure, classic white picket fence, or a different wood fencing structure. But it’s not a set it and forget it material. You will need to seal it, keep bugs and moisture out of the wood, and more.

This blog will help you understand how to coat your wood fence, what sealants to use, and whether wood is the right material for you. If you’d like a complimentary quote from our [Charleston fence company](https://southern-fence.com/charleston/), please get in touch.

## **Water Sealants are Better Than Paint For Wood Fencing**

Wood fences can deteriorate quickly. Contrary to popular belief, *painting* a wood fence does not offer sufficient protection. Water sealants, on the other hand, provide superior long-term benefits. Unlike paint, which sits on the surface and can peel or crack over time, water sealants penetrate the wood, creating a barrier that repels moisture and prevents rot, warping, and mold growth.

If you don’t seal your wood fence, you leave it vulnerable to rain, humidity, and temperature changes. Moisture seeps into the wood and causes it to expand and contract, and over time, this movement leads to cracks, splitting, and a weakened structure. Mildew and fungi will also accelerate the decay of unsealed wood. Also keep in mind that it’s expensive to replace sections or even single planks of rotted wood! Sealing a fence is a chore, but it will save you money and time in the future. Any skilled [fence installation company ](https://southern-fence.com/summerville-fence-company/)will seal your wooden fence before considering the job done.

## **How Many Coats of Water Sealant Do You Need to Add on a Wood Fence?**

A new, untreated fence will typically need at least two coats for proper absorption and protection, but many professionals recommend even more. The first coat soaks into the wood, and the second adds a stronger barrier against moisture. If the fence is older or has been previously treated, a single coat may suffice, but an additional layer improves durability.

For best results, apply the sealant when the wood is dry and the temperatures are moderate. If the wood has been pressure-treated, wait several weeks before sealing to allow it to dry completely. Spraying, rolling, or brushing on the sealant evenly gives you a thorough coat that penetrates deep into the wood. We’ll let you know if the wood you’ve chosen requires back-brushing – we sometimes have to work against the grain to get the sealant in there.

### **Will You Need to Reapply Water Sealant Over Time?**

Yes, reapplication is necessary to maintain protection. The frequency depends on the type of sealant used, weather conditions, and how much exposure the fence has to sun and rain. A high-quality water-based or oil-based sealant typically lasts two to three years before requiring a fresh application. Fences in areas with extreme weather or heavy rain may need resealing sooner.

You can actually test your wood sealant’s status by spraying a small section of the fence with water. This will reveal if the sealant is still effective. If the water beads up and rolls off, the barrier is intact. If the water absorbs into the wood, it's time to reapply the sealant to prevent damage.

### **Some Quality Water Sealant Brands That Contractors Use**

Thompson’s WaterSeal is probably the most well-known sealer out there, and it works well and is easy enough to apply. It does require reapplication every year or two. Prices range from $20 to $30 per gallon.

DEFY Extreme Wood Stain and Sealer is a high-performance, water-based sealant that resists UV damage, mildew, and fading. It costs around $45 to $55 per gallon but lasts longer than many cheaper options.

Ready Seal is an oil-based, semi-transparent sealer that also gives your wooden fence a trademark look while blocking water. It requires no primer or back-brushing, which is a huge benefit. It costs between $40 and $50 per gallon and typically lasts two to three years.

Last option for now: Seal-Once Nano+Poly Penetrating Wood Sealer. This is considered a premium product, and it doesn’t have any toxic chemicals. Some applications even last up to six years. But the $60 to $70 per gallon price tag is a bit hot for many homeowners.

## **Other Upkeep Required of Wood Fencing**

Cleaning the fence annually removes dirt, mold, and algae that can cause discoloration or decay. A mixture of mild soap and water works for light cleaning, while a diluted bleach solution helps eliminate mold and mildew.

You’ll need to inspect the fence regularly for loose boards, nails, or structural damage as well. Keep an eye out for broken pickets, fix wobbly posts, and tighten hardware to keep your fence in good shape for many years.

Also, if you keep bushes, trees and other plants trimmed away from the fence, it allows moisture to dry and will keep your fence “alive” longer, all other things being equal.

## **Is Wood Too Much Maintenance? You Have Options**

Vinyl fencing has come a long way in replicating the natural grain of wood. High-quality vinyl options closely resemble traditional wood fencing but require minimal maintenance. Vinyl does not absorb water, resist fading, and never needs to be sealed, painted, or stained. While the initial cost is higher, often between $25 to $40 per linear foot, the long-term savings on maintenance make it a cost-effective choice.

Composite fencing is another durable alternative, made from a mix of wood fibers and recycled plastic. It has the appearance of wood but does not warp, crack, or rot like natural lumber. Composite fencing resists insects and moisture, making it a long-lasting solution. Prices vary depending on the brand and style but generally range from $30 to $50 per linear foot.

Aluminum fencing with wood-grain finishes provides a unique combination of strength and style. While not an exact match to real wood, aluminum fencing can achieve a similar aesthetic without requiring sealants or repairs. It is lightweight, rust-resistant, and holds up well in harsh weather. Costs typically start around $35 per linear foot but require almost no upkeep.

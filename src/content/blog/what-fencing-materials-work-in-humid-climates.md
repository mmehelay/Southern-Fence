Southern Fence helps homeowners in South Carolina’s Lowcountry, and we understand humidity. Moisture, seasonal storms, wind, bugs, plants, and mildew can all wreak havoc on your fence. This blog will help you choose the right material based on your budget, location, and appetite for maintenance.

## **Why Some Fencing Materials Fail in Humid Climates**

Wood fencing is a traditional choice, but without proper [wood sealing](https://southern-fence.com/blog/guide-to-water-sealants-for-your-wood-fence/) and maintenance, it absorbs moisture, leading to swelling, cracking, and rot. Insects love damp conditions, and they’ll take advantage of your wooden fence. Even pressure-treated wood requires regular sealing and staining to protect against humidity.

It’s not common in residential environments, but tteel fencing is another material that struggles in humid environments unless it has a protective coating. Bare or untreated steel rusts quickly, especially in coastal areas with salt in the air. Galvanized and powder-coated steel offers decent resistance, but any scratches or damage to the coating can expose the metal to moisture.

Certain composite materials also fail in humidity when their composition includes too much wood fiber. All things considered, avoid lower-quality composites that absorb moisture and suffer from warping or mold growth. We would be happy to speak with you about the kinds of imitation wood products that will not do well in coastal South Carolina.

## **The Best Fencing Materials for Humid Climates**

### **Vinyl Fencing Holds Up in High Humidity**

Vinyl fencing is one of the most reliable choices for humid climates. Made from durable PVC, it does not absorb water, preventing swelling, rot, and mold growth. Vinyl fences require little maintenance beyond occasional cleaning and do not need painting or staining. Since the material is nonporous, it resists insect damage, making it a long-lasting option in regions with high moisture levels.

Though vinyl fencing is highly durable, extreme heat can cause it to expand and contract. Choosing high-quality vinyl with UV inhibitors helps prevent discoloration and brittleness over time. While the upfront cost of vinyl fencing is higher than some materials, its longevity and low maintenance requirements make it a cost-effective choice for homeowners in humid areas.

### **Aluminum Fencing Offers Rust Resistance**

Aluminum fencing provides the look of wrought iron without the risk of rust. Unlike steel, aluminum does not corrode when exposed to moisture.. Powder-coated aluminum fences add another layer of protection against weather-related damage, maintaining their finish for years with minimal upkeep.

Because aluminum is lightweight, it is easier to install than some other fencing materials. It also offers design flexibility, with various styles and colors available to match different property aesthetics. Though aluminum is not as strong as steel, its resistance to rust and decay makes it a superior choice for areas with high humidity.

### **Composite Fencing Withstands Moisture When Made Well**

High-quality composite fencing provides the appearance of wood without the risk of rot or insect damage. Not all composite materials are created equal, so choose one with a high percentage of plastic. Some composites even include protective coatings that prevent water absorption and UV damage, making them well-suited for humid regions. Composite fencing is sometimes more expensive than wood upfront, but it can last much longer without the maintenance.

Trex Fencing offers the Seclusions line, which blends recycled wood fibers and plastic for a rot-resistant fence. Fiberon Fencing manufactures Horizon and Sanctuary fences with a polymer cap that shields against moisture and fading. SimTek Fence (a division of CertainTeed) provides Ecostone and Ashland fencing, which are both designed to resist water damage while mimicking the look of wood and stone.You can also choose from TimberTech Fencing, MoistureShield Fencing and more. Call us if you’d like more information.

### **Cedar and Redwood Perform Better Than Other Woods**

Cedar and redwood offer natural resistance to moisture, insects, and decay. These woods contain oils and tannins that help repel water, reducing the risk of rot and fungal growth. Cedar, in particular, has the ability to withstand humidity with less shrinkage and warping than other wood types.

You still have to apply a high-quality sealant or water-repellent stain ti redwood and cedar though, otherwise your investment in these premium woods will be for nothing.

## **How to Maintain a Fence in a Humid Climate**

### **Regular Cleaning Prevents Mold and Mildew**

Humidity encourages the growth of mold, mildew, and algae, especially on wood and composite fencing. Cleaning the fence with a mild detergent or a diluted bleach solution removes buildup and prevents staining. A pressure washer on a low setting can also help keep the fence looking fresh without damaging the material.

### **Sealing and Coating Extend the Life of Wood and Metal Fences**

Apply a water-repellent sealant to your wood fence to help prevent moisture absorption and decay. For metal fences, checking for scratches or chips in the protective coating and touching up damaged areas prevents rust formation. Even aluminum fences benefit from occasional cleaning and inspection to maintain their appearance.

### **Proper Installation Prevents Water Damage**

Installing the fence correctly can make a big difference. Leaving gaps between fence boards gives the wood better airflow, and posts should be set in concrete to prevent water from pooling at the base, which can lead to rot or instability. 

## **Alternative Low-Maintenance Options for High Humidity**

If wood sounds intimidating, you can simply install vinyl or aluminum.. And if you want to use a composite material for your fence, don’t use a cheap one. Invest in a high quality composite fence that will last for many years.. Homeowners who prefer real wood should opt for naturally resistant species like cedar or redwood and commit to routine maintenance.

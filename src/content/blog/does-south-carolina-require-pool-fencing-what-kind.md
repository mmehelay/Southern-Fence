## Does South Carolina Require Pool Fencing? What Kind?

Installing a pool in the Lowcountry comes with an important safety requirement: a compliant barrier. South Carolina law and national building codes demand specific fencing standards for residential pools. If you’d like help designing and installing a pool fence that meets every requirement, call Southern Fence at 843-846-1704.

### Quick Reference: Local Pool Fence Rules

| Location | Minimum Height | Gate Rules | Special Notes |
|----------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| [Hilton Head Island](https://hiltonheadislandsc.gov/communitydevelopment/) | 4 ft (residential), 6 ft (public) | Self-closing, self-latching, swings away | Permit required for all fences, including pool barriers |
| [Bluffton](https://www.townofbluffton.sc.gov/343/Planning-Zoning) | 4 ft (residential) | Self-closing, self-latching | Zoning approval required; may have material restrictions in visible areas |
| [Charleston](https://www.charleston-sc.gov/) | 4 ft (residential), 6 ft (public) | Self-closing, self-latching, swings away | May require BAR review in historic districts |
| [Beaufort](https://www.cityofbeaufort.org/) | 4 ft (residential), 6 ft (public) | Self-closing, self-latching | Permit required for most installations; setbacks apply |

### Statewide Requirement for Residential Pool Fences

South Carolina follows the International Swimming Pool and Spa Code (ISPSC), which applies to all residential pools over 24 inches deep, including in-ground, above-ground, and spas. The key rules are:

- The fence must be at least 48 inches (4 feet) tall, measured from the outside ground level.  
- The gap between the ground and the bottom of the fence must not exceed 2 inches on non-solid surfaces, or 4 inches if the pool structure forms part of the barrier.  
- No opening in the barrier may allow passage of a 4-inch diameter sphere.  
- Horizontal rails under 45 inches apart must be installed on the pool-facing side, with vertical spacing between pickets capped at 1¾ inches. If horizontal spacing exceeds 45 inches, vertical spacing may be up to 4 inches, but decorative cutouts are still limited to 1¾ inches.  
- The gate must be self-closing and self-latching, swing away from the pool, and the latch should be 54 inches above ground or at least 3 inches below the gate top if on the pool-facing side.  

More details can be found in [South Carolina’s pool fence requirements](https://poolguardusa.com/pool-fence-requirements-south-carolina/) and in the [Berkeley County Swimming Pool Enclosures and Safety Devices PDF](https://berkeleycountysc.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/Swimming-Pool-Enclosures-Safety-Devices.pdf).

### Local Codes May Add Layers

Many South Carolina municipalities follow ISPSC rules, but your city or county may enforce additional requirements:

- In [Greenville](https://poolguardusa.com/pool-fence-requirements-south-carolina/), fences must meet all state clear-gap rules and include climb-resistant design and tamper-proof gates.  
- In [Horry County](https://horrycountysc.gov/media/kamkas30/pool-fence-affidavit.pdf), pools need barriers extending at least 3 feet horizontally around the perimeter and be inspected before first use.  
- [Berkeley County](https://berkeleycountysc.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/Swimming-Pool-Enclosures-Safety-Devices.pdf) mandates a 4-foot barrier without openings larger than 4 inches, plus self-closing and self-latching gates.  
- Public pools in [Charleston](https://www.allenlawsc.com/blog/about-charlestons-pool-fence-rules-and-regulations/), such as HOA or community amenities, often require 6-foot fences with the same minimal opening rules.  

### Why It Matters

Children, pets, or wildlife can access your pool area in seconds. A properly coded fence prevents tragic accidents and helps your property pass inspection. It also minimizes liability and potential insurance disputes. More information is available from the [South Carolina Department of Insurance](https://doi.sc.gov/961/Pools-and-Insurance-What-You-Should-Know).

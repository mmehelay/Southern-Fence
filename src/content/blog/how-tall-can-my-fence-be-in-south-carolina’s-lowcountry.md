## **Fence Height Requirements in Charleston**

Charleston generally caps front yard fences at 4 feet and rear or side fences at 6 feet. If your property falls within a historic district, the fence may need review by the Board of Architectural Review (BAR). You must follow BAR submittal rules and meet zoning requirements first. Learn more from the city's official [BAR submittal guide](https://www.charleston-sc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1266/BAR-Submittal-Requirements-Fence-and-Sitework?bidId=).

Under Charleston County [rules](https://www.charlestoncounty.org/departments/zoning-planning/code-enforcement.php), a zoning permit is not required for fences under 6 feet unless made of brick, stone, or concrete, or if they block driveway sight lines. For changes above that height or with heavier materials, you must secure a permit.

## **Fence Height Requirements in Hilton Head Island**

On Hilton Head Island, you need a zoning permit for every fence, no matter the height. Front yard fences are limited to 4 feet, and side or rear fences may go up to 6 feet. Certain materials, such as chain link in visible or conservation areas, may be discouraged or restricted. Visit the [Hilton Head Community Development](https://hiltonheadislandsc.gov/communitydevelopment/) department for more details.

## **Fence Height Requirements in Bluffton**

Bluffton requires zoning approval for all fences. Typical height limits align with 4 feet in front yards and 6 feet in rear or side yards. A setback of 12 inches from the property line is standard unless neighbors agree to a shared fence. Historic district properties may need design review, and certain materials, especially unfinished chain link, may not be allowed in highly visible areas. See the Town of Bluffton Planning department for current requirements.

## **Fence Height Requirements in Beaufort**

In Beaufort, zoning regulates fences on private property, and permits are required for most new installations. Front yard fences typically cap at 4 feet, while rear or side yard fences can reach 6 feet. A minimum setback of 1 foot from property lines is standard, though some neighborhoods may enforce more stringent rules.

In unincorporated parts of Beaufort County, front yard fences must not exceed 4 feet in height, including fences on corner side street yards. Review the Beaufort County Community Development Code for details.

## **Special Considerations: Visibility, Pools, Privacy Panels**

Visibility matters at driveways and street corners. In Charleston, you must avoid blocking sight lines at driveways. Details are available in the [Charleston County zoning code](https://www.charlestoncounty.org/departments/zoning-planning/code-enforcement.php).

If your fence surrounds a pool, typical height rules also apply, such as 4 feet for front yards and 6 feet for rear or side yards, but many municipalities also require self-closing and self-latching gates to meet safety codes. It is best to check your local code on pool barriers.

Solid privacy fences, especially those reaching 6 feet, are often permitted in rear or side yards as long as they comply with material restrictions. Bluffton may ban raw chain link in prominent areas, and Hilton Head may require permits regardless of materials.

## **A Quick Comparison**

Charleston, Bluffton, and Beaufort: expect a 4 foot front yard limit and 6 foot rear or side yard limit. Historic or regulated districts may require additional review. Setbacks of 6 inches to 1 foot are common.
On Hilton Head Island, a permit is required for every fence. Front yards cap at 4 feet, rear and side at 6 feet. Materials may be restricted, especially in sensitive zones.

## **Before You Build**

Fencing rules may vary within neighborhoods, HOAs, or overlay zones. Check with your local zoning or planning office, or use your municipality’s online code resources to confirm height limits, setback rules, or permit needs.
